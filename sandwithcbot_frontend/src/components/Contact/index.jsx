                    I hope we can have communication by Gmail, Telegram or
                    Discord.

                <p>Freelancer is good platform for work, however,
                    there are some difficulty to have good communication.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, the Freelancer dislikes crypto currency bot
                    projects. Please contact me here, thank you.</p>
